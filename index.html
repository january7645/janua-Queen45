        <h1>Traveling for work</h1>
        <p style="color:rgb(135, 12, 129);">I am a Web Developer, who loves to travel the world while I work.  I am a proficient, efficient, precise, and attentive  new coder.  I enjoy my Zen time, which is mostly 18 hours a day. </p>
        <h2>Why I chose to work this way</h2>
        <p>One of the millions of reasons why I chose this way to work is due to, my love for diversity in the world.  I want to see all the continents, all the different landscapes provided by mother nature.  All the vastly different cultures, the people the food and the beautiful land, and rivers and lakes and oceans, and greenery or lack of greenery.</p>
